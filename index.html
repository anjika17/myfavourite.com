         My favourite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I started to do it when I was seven years old. The first time I did it, I felt interested. So I kept reading. The teachers always taught me to read the difficult words. There are a lot of advantages of reading. Reading can make me relaxed and calm. I can also learn new
words. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me an unlimited imagination, so I can write books in the future. I can learn the different cultures and customs of other countries in the world too.
 I read at least one hour every day. I read books by myself. I usually read it
at home. My favorite author is Ruskin bond and Sudha Murthy. I love to read his stories as they take me to a world that I fantasize.       </p>
